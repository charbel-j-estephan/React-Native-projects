## 🧠 Why I Built This

As a student starting with React Native, I wanted to challenge myself with a small but complete project. This calculator helped me understand component structure, state handling, styling, and working with dynamic themes. It’s the foundation for more complex apps involving user interaction and data.

## 🔮 Next Steps

- ⛅ Integrate live APIs (weather, currency, etc.)
- 📜 Add a calculation history panel
- 💾 Possibly local storage support
